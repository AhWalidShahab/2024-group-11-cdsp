# Communication

## Group Rules

1. Branching Strategy:

   - At first always make pull request to download recent changes from remove repo.
   - Create feature branches for new features or bug fixes.

2. Commit Guidelines:

   - Write clear and concise commit messages.
   - Use present-tense verbs (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
   - Reference relevant issues or pull requests in commit messages.

3. Code Style:

   - Agree on and adhere to a consistent code style - PEP 8 for Python.
   - Use linters and automated formatting tools to maintain code style.

4. Documentation:

   - Document code thoroughly, including function/method comments and README files.
   - Use a consistent format for documentation.

5. Code Reviews:

   - Require code reviews before merging branches.
   - Provide constructive feedback during code reviews.
   - Use code review tools and integrations, if available.

6. Issue Tracking:

   - Use GitHub Issues or a similar system for tracking bugs, features, and tasks.
   - Clearly define issue templates and use labels appropriately.

7. Pull Requests:

   - Clearly describe the purpose of pull requests.
   - Ensure that all tests pass before merging.

8. Version Control:

   - Avoid force-pushing to shared branches.
   - Use descriptive branch and tag names.

9. Security Practices:

   - Regularly update dependencies and libraries.

10. Collaboration and Communication:

    - Use GitHub Discussions or other communication channels for team discussions.
    - Clearly communicate project milestones and deadlines.

11. Git Etiquette:

    - Avoid committing large binary files directly to the repository.
      -Be mindful of the commit history; squash or rebase when necessary.

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _30 -> 60 min_: Try on your own
2. _60 -> 90 min_: Ask your group for help
3. _90+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
