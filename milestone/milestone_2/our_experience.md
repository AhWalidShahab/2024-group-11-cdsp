My experience with Zero Waste includes studying and adapting best practices, particularly those used in Denmark. Denmark is known for its advanced environmental policy and sustainable development efforts, especially in combating waste in the food and restaurant sectors.

1. One of the key methods I've learned about is the use of the Too Good To Go service. This service, widely used in Denmark, offers a mobile application connecting customers with restaurants and stores that have surplus unsold food. Through this app, users can purchase sets of products or dishes that would otherwise be discarded at the end of the workday according to technological processes.

2. Additionally, Denmark has a large network of volunteer organizations that actively assist in food sharing. These organizations play an important role in reducing waste and promoting social interaction and cooperation within local communities.

3. Recently, I attended a FoodSharing Startup Event, where volunteers gathered to share experiences, listen to proposals, and discuss plans for the next quarter. This event further inspired me to actively participate in initiatives aimed at reducing waste and promoting Zero Waste practices within my local community.
