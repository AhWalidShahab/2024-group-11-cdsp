My experience with Zero Waste includes studying and adapting best practices, particularly those used in Denmark. Denmark is known for its advanced environmental policy and sustainable development efforts, especially in combating waste in the food and restaurant sectors.

1. One of the key methods I've learned about is the use of the Too Good To Go service. This service, widely used in Denmark, offers a mobile application connecting customers with restaurants and stores that have surplus unsold food. Through this app, users can purchase sets of products or dishes that would otherwise be discarded at the end of the workday according to technological processes.

2. Additionally, Denmark has a large network of volunteer organizations that actively assist in food sharing. These organizations play an important role in reducing waste and promoting social interaction and cooperation within local communities.

3. Recently, I attended a FoodSharing Startup Event, where volunteers gathered to share experiences, listen to proposals, and discuss plans for the next quarter. This event further inspired me to actively participate in initiatives aimed at reducing waste and promoting Zero Waste practices within my local community.

I have experience of Zero Waste in couple countries and in couple states across USA. My latest experience about Massachusetts state. State launched Solid Waste Master Plan, the document establishes goals to reduce disposal statewide by 30 percent (from 5.7 million tons in 2018 to 4 million tons in 2030) over the next decade. It sets a long-term goal of achieving a 90 percent reduction in disposal to 570,000 tons by 2050. 

Here I want to provide of some interesting key points for becoming zero waste for my opinion:

1. Refuse – Say no to disposable single-use plastic, coffee cups, utensils, straws, shopping bags, and anything that you could replace with a reusable option. For more suggestions of disposable products that you can replace with reusable or eco-friendly options, read 43 Ways to Reduce Your Plastic Disposable Waste. 

2. Reduce – Be mindful of what you buy. Purchase only what you need and limit impulse purchases. Buy secondhand items whenever possible for clothing, furniture, etc. Learn more about ways to reduce how many new clothes you buy.

3. Reuse – Before you throw something out, think about whether you could repair or reuse it for another purpose. Breathe new life into old pieces of furniture or donate these items. Visit Beyond the Bin to find a local donation center. For old clothes, swap parties are gaining in popularity. Go through your closet, gather a group of friends, and do a swap rather than a shop! 

4. Recycle – While recycling isn’t fully sustainable, it’s better than sending recyclable materials to landfills and incinerators. To ensure you are recycling correctly, visit the RecycleSmartMA website to access their Recyclopedia tool. 

5. Rot – Compost! It doesn’t matter if you live in a tiny apartment in the city or on a ten-acre farm, composting options are available to you. About 26% of the waste stream in Massachusetts is composed of organic waste. Composting reduces the volume of waste going to landfills or waste-to-energy incinerators.
