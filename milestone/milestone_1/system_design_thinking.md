## Systems Thinking:

1. Understanding Connections: See how different things like social norms, money, the environment, and culture affect how much food gets wasted and how it's managed. Think about how all these things work together.

2. Finding Loops: Look for patterns where one thing affects another, like how rules in one place might change how much trash gets made or how things get recycled.

3. Setting Limits: Figure out where to draw the line on what you're studying and see how it connects to bigger things like money and society. Think about how changes in one area might cause changes in others.

4. Mapping Systems: Make pictures that show how everything is connected, like drawing circles and lines to show how one thing leads to another. This helps find the most important places where we can make things better.

## Design Thinking:

1. Understanding People: We will use our own experience and data obtained from open sources to gain insights into waste management. We will analyze existing information to understand the needs and challenges faced by various stakeholders, such as government bodies, businesses, local communities, and individuals.

2. Defining the Issue: We will identify the main problems by analyzing what these groups say. We will find the big challenges and opportunities to improve the situation with food waste in different countries, relying on our own experience and data obtained from open sources.

3. Generating Ideas: We will come up with new and creative ways to reduce food waste by brainstorming together. We will test these ideas on simulated versions or small projects to assess their effectiveness.

4. Making Progress: We will continue to try out new ideas and improve them, listening to feedback from participants and looking at the facts. We will ensure that any solutions are easy to use, fit with the culture, and take into account the perspectives of all stakeholders.
